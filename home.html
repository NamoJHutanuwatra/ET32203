				<center><h2><strong>ABOUT ME..</strong></h2></center>
				<p class="Namo">
					Hi, I'm Namo, a football enthusiast and a devoted Manchester City supporter. Football is a huge part
					of my life, but I enjoy playing sports in general, whether it's kicking a ball on the field,
					shooting hoops, or trying out something new. There's something about the teamwork and the thrill of
					competition that keeps me coming back for more. When Im not playing sports, I like to stay active
					by watching games, analyzing plays, and keeping up with my favorite teams. <br>

					Outside of sports, Im a huge fan of music and video games. I love the way music can set the mood
					and energize me, whether Im studying, working out, or just relaxing. Video games, on the other
					hand, offer a different kind of excitement—whether its teaming up with friends in multiplayer games
					or immersing myself in a single-player adventure. Both are great outlets for creativity and help me
					unwind after a busy day. <br>

					I recently had the incredible opportunity to spend a year in France as an exchange student. It was a
					life-changing experience that opened my eyes to new cultures, languages, and perspectives. While
					studying in France, I also got to deepen my love for languages and computer science, two areas I'm
					passionate about. The time abroad helped me grow personally and academically, giving me skills Ill
					carry forward in my future endeavors. <br>

					My girlfriend, Alina, and I share many interests, from sports to music and everything in between.
					Even though we're in a long-distance relationship at the moment, we make it work by staying
					connected and supporting each other. Its been a journey balancing school, hobbies, and my
					relationship, but I wouldnt trade it for anything. We always find time to cheer each other on and
					enjoy our passions together, even when we're miles apart.

							"Payphone" by Maroon 5 featuring Wiz Khalifa is a song about the pain of a failed
							relationship and longing for what could have been. Adam Levine sings about standing at a
							payphone, trying to reach someone he loved, reflecting on how their time together was wasted
							and how their plans fell apart. The lyrics express regret, frustration, and the realization
							that theres no going back. Wiz Khalifas rap verse contrasts with the sorrowful tone,
							focusing on moving forward and achieving success despite the heartbreak. The song blends pop
							and rap elements, delivering an emotional yet catchy anthem about lost love and the
							struggles of letting go.

							"Another Love" by Tom Odell is a melancholic song about emotional exhaustion and heartache.
							The narrator expresses frustration over his inability to fully love someone new because of
							past heartbreak. He describes feeling drained, having given his all to previous
							relationships, and now finding it difficult to offer the same level of love and
							vulnerability. The chorus, with its repeated line "I'll use another love," conveys a deep
							sense of longing and the hope for emotional healing. <br>
							The song is driven by a haunting piano melody, accompanied by Odell's raw, emotive vocals,
							which rise in intensity as he expresses his inner turmoil. "Another Love" captures the pain
							of being stuck in emotional limbo—wanting to love again but feeling weighed down by old
							scars. Its powerful lyrics and passionate delivery have made it resonate with listeners who
							have experienced similar feelings of emotional weariness.
